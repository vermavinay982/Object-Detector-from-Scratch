# Object-Detector-from-Scratch
Inspired by YOLO, using pre-trained weights and image splitting, Here I am localizing and classifying the objects to understand in-depth how it works.
By using this we can find out which parts in the image are having maximum contribution in calling the arrangement of pixels and `Elephant`

Color of the boxes are as per the confidence of classifier for the particular segment of image.

Green - High Confidence & Red - Lower Confidence
